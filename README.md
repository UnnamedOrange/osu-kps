# osu!kps

KPS (keys per second) indicator for osu! in C++.

This project is under occasional maintenance.

## Motivation

It's been a long time since I wrote a complete project. osu!kps could be a best chance for me to develop a new framework in C++.

## Environment

Target platform: Windows® 10.

IDE: Visual Studio® 2019.

Language: C++20.

Graphics: Direct2D and DirectWrite.

## How to get the executable

If you are a developer, it's strongly recommended that you deploy this project on your own. Just follow the steps below.

1. Make sure your PC runs Windows® 10, which should not be too old.
2. Install Visual Studio® 2019, with toolkits of Windows desktop applications in C++.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Open the solution file with VS.
5. Select "Release" and "x64", and build the project.
6. Runs the executable.

If you are not familiar with programming, you can go to the release page, and download the latest version of it (osu-kps-x64.exe) and run.

## Roadmap

The remaining targets won't be updated recently.

- [x] first beta release.

- [ ] add more keys in keyboard_char.

- [ ] add keyboard shortcut.

- [ ] do the documents.

  After this step the project can be released.

- [ ] implement functions specific to osu!.

## Details

### The "hard" method to calculate KPS

It just saves all key strokes, and based on it, calculates KPS. The KPS equals to the total times you stroke in recent 1 second.

### The "sensitive" method to calculate KPS

This method allows the situation that KPS is higher than the number of keys you stroke in recent 1 second. Details will be written in the documents (not ready yet).
